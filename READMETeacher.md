Here you can see my homework. I created a program that interacts with a database of supposedly medical clinic. There are separate tables for patients, doctors, and appointments. Each of them has its own class, which has methods for inserting, updating, deleting, and reading the Database. Used all that was required in a text file assignment-5.
